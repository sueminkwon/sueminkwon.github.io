        <div class="subheading mb-5">Elementary School Teacherüè´</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I‚Äôm a fourth-year English major with a unique perspective shaped by my Korean-Canadian background and a deep love for storytelling. I‚Äôm passionate about language and enjoy exploring how classic literature connects to today‚Äôs world. Throughout my studies, I‚Äôve learned to appreciate the richness of diverse voices in literature, and I want to share this appreciation with others. My goal is to become an elementary school teacher, where I can bring my love for language and creativity into a classroom setting and inspire young minds.

One of my strongest passions is music. Not only do I love listening to it, but I also play several instruments, including the piano, violin, and flute. Music brings me a lot of joy, and it feels like a way to express emotions and connect with others. I believe music can be a powerful tool for learning and hope to incorporate it into my teaching. I see music as another way to help students engage with the world around them, making learning more enjoyable and accessible. Whether it‚Äôs through teaching rhythm, singing along to stories, or simply listening to background music while working, I believe that music can add a special dynamic to a classroom.<br><br>

        In addition to my academic and musical interests, I‚Äôve gained practical experience through various part-time jobs. Working in different environments has taught me valuable skills in communication, teamwork, and adaptability. These experiences helped me understand the importance of collaborating with others, adapting to new situations, and managing responsibilities effectively. I‚Äôm excited to bring these skills into my future classroom, where I‚Äôll foster a positive and inclusive environment where students feel comfortable exploring, asking questions, and discovering new interests.

As I prepare for my future career as a teacher, I‚Äôm dedicated to creating a classroom that feels welcoming and encourages curiosity. I want my students to feel excited about learning, and I aim to bring a mix of storytelling, music, and hands-on projects to keep them engaged. My goal is to help young students find their voices, whether it‚Äôs through writing, speaking, or creative expression. I believe that every child has something unique to offer, and as a teacher, I want to help them build confidence in who they are and what they can achieve.<br><br>

        I‚Äôm also deeply committed to promoting cultural understanding and inclusivity. I want my classroom to be a place where students from all backgrounds feel seen and respected. Growing up as a Korean-Canadian, I know the value of embracing different perspectives, and I plan to bring that awareness into my teaching. I hope to celebrate my students' unique experiences and encourage them to appreciate diversity in all its forms.

Overall, I‚Äôm excited about the future and look forward to combining my love for language, creativity, and music to make a positive impact on my students' lives. Teaching is more than a career to me; it‚Äôs a way to make a meaningful difference. Whether through storytelling, musical activities, or creative projects, I am ready to inspire, support, and guide my future students as they grow and learn.
